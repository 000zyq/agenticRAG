## UI discrepancy review
- Implemented `Next Conflict` wrap-around navigation in `frontend/app/page.tsx` so navigation does not stall at list tail.
- Added active-card auto-scroll to keep current conflict visible while navigating.
- Changed `fiscal_year` default input value to empty string to avoid implicit default filtering.

## Browser verification (manual with Chrome DevTools)
- Opened `http://127.0.0.1:3001/` and loaded report `2` discrepancies.
- Confirmed `Next Conflict` increments active card index (`0 -> 1 -> 2 ...`) and wraps (`26 -> 0`).
- Confirmed right PDF panel tracks selected conflict page (`current page` updated and iframe URL page hash matches).

## Notes / known environment constraints
- `frontend` lint is not configured (`next lint` asks interactive setup).
- `frontend` production build currently fails on existing upstream type conflict in `frontend/app/api/copilotkit/route.ts` (`HttpAgent` vs `AbstractAgent`), unrelated to this UI patch.
- In DevTools automation, clearing `fiscal_year` via scripted input can be flaky; manual browser input should be used for final UX confirmation.
- Added `Clear Year` control in discrepancy filters to guarantee users can remove fiscal-year filtering in one click.
- Re-verified after this UI tweak: load + next conflict navigation and page sync remain correct.
